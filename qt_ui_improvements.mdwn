[[!meta title="Improvements that can be done to the QT UI"]]

The QT UI is far from complete and requires a lot of love to be finished.
A large majority of these things are fairly simple, just require time put towards it.

#List of things
## Easy
-	Start a debugger UI
	-	Create the Window
	-	Create the toolbar
	-	Show instruction disassembly

## Moderate
-	Create a functional API between the core and UI
	-	Allows multiple UIs to use the same API
	-	Can begin libdolphin

## Hard
-	**None Currently**
